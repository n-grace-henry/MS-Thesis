# and "AAID" which the the amino acid identification from the GC output

#### Correct to international standard of N air ####
#Calculations of offset values were done in R script "Correct_to_Nair.R"
#Three EA runs were looked at, the second was chosen as the most representative to base corrections off
#No linear relationship was found between offset and measured value so one average value
#will be applied to raw data
#The offset values were calculated as EA measured d15N - reference
